Firstly I created a docker file with all the required dependencies(libraries) installed.
I built an image of that file and then created it's container.
Next I created a new Notebook on Jupyter Notebook named "my_notebook.ipynb".
I gave the file an unformatted markdown instruction. Then using the terminal window I formatted the file using nbqa library to get a correctly formated my_notebook.ipynb file.
