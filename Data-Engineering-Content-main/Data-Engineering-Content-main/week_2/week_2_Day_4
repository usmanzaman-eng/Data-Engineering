Raw data is visually(graphically) represented so that it would be understood easily.
Numerical Data( represented by numeric values):Continuous data can have data from a infinite(to some extent) set of values opposite for Discrete data.
Categorical Data (Represented by strings used to define different categories):Ordinal when we can give categories an order like short,tall etc.Nominal are ones where they cant be ordered like Name or hair color etc.
BAR GRAPHS ARE USED TO COMPARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DISCRETE CATEGORIES
PIE CHARTS ARE USEFUL FOR COMPARING DATA AS A PART OF THE WHOLE
SCATTER PLOT CAN BE USED TO VISUALIZE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES
LINE GRAPH IS OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE TIME SERIES AND PROGRESS IN DATA
HISTOGRAMS ARE USED TO REPRESENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF A NUMERICAL VARIABLE
HEATMAPS USE COLOR TO REPRESENT VARIABLES INTENSITY
